Colliding stars and black holes Open Data Workshop

This page serves as a cover page for the Open Data Workshop, presented as part
of the Colliding stars and black holes event at Cardiff University.

------------
Introduction
------------

This workshop extends the extensive material prepared for the
`LIGO Open Data Workshop <https://losc.ligo.org/s/workshop1/course.html>`__,
held at the California Institute of Technology.

All of the material for that workshop is freely available under the
`MIT License <https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/>`__.

Software setup
--------------

There are 4 options for getting access to the software described on the
`Setup page <https://github.com/gw-odw/odw-2018/tree/master/setup/README.md>`__.
However, if you haven't already set things up, I recommend the easiest solution:
**use Microsoft Azure**:

#. go to https://notebooks.azure.com/losc/libraries/odw-2018,
   **if you don't have an account, you will need to create one**,

#. click the *Clone* button to create a copy of the notebooks on your account:

#. click on *odw-2018* to open the folder containing the materials

#. open one of the notebooks from your own account,

Notebooks
---------

The schedule allows for 2 one-hour sessions, which is not enough to visit each
of the notebooks from the original workshop in detail, so I suggest the
following subset of the material:

#. ``gwpy/0 - GWOpenSci.ipynb``

#. ``gwpy/2b - Signal processing with GWpy.ipynb``

#. ``pycbc/1_CatalogData.ipynb``

#. ``pycbc/3_WaveformMatchedFilter.ipynb``

#. ``parameter_estimation/Calculating a Posterior Probability Density Function.ipynb``
